A Typist's 65c02 Assembler in Forth

First version: 07. Nov 2014 ("N7 Day")
This version: 27. May 2015 (BETA 0.1)

This is an assembler for the 65c02 8-bit MPU written in gforth. 


WHAT YOU SHOULD DO

Read MANUAL.txt where everything is explained. Then look at the example files

        example.fs
        rom.fs 

You can use a simulator such as py65mon to test the output of rom.fs . 


WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW

This assembler makes a few assumptions:

- It is written by and primary for people who touch-type -- hence the name. This is why there are few special characters (like $ or [) in the syntax: They take too much time to reach with your fingers. 

- It is written for the 65c02 (more specifically, the WDC 65c02) only. It shouldn't be a problem to adapt it to, say, the original 6502, but this version makes no such attempt. 

- It is written for people who have at least some basic familiarity with Forth. The Manual does some hand-holding, but not much.  

- It assumes you are using gforth (https://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/). The source code points out where gforth-specific words are used that are not part of ANS Forth.

Again, read the Manual.
